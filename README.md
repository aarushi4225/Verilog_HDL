# Verilog_HDL_Digital_Design
This repository serves as both a library of reusable Verilog HDL modules and a collection of digital design basic circuits.

Library of Reusable Modules:  This repository contains implementations of essential building blocks, ranging from basic logic gates to some complex components like adders, multipliers, etc. These modules are designed with clarity, efficiency, and easy integration into larger projects in mind.

This repository also showcases my Verilog HDL implementations of various digital design projects.  These projects demonstrate the application of the reusable modules and explore more advanced design concepts.  
I am continuously adding new modules and projects as I learn and explore digital design with Verilog. Feel free to use, contribute, and suggest improvements!
